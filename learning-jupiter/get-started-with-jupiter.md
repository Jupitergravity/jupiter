# Get started with Jupiter

## Becoming your own moon base

Running a full Jupiter node is a fairly straight forward process:

```
wget https://github.com/jupiter-project/jupiter/releases/download/v2.4.3/jrs-client-v2.4.3.zip
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Install Java 8 for Debian/Ubuntu based Linux.
{% endhint %}

```text
apt install openjdk-8-jdk-headless
```

Unzip and run start.sh \(Linux/Mac\) or run.bat \(Windows\):

```text
bash start.sh
```
